Project 1: I used a neural net code in a predictive analysis of the probability of a local epidemic hitting a place, according to data extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO). In this predictive analysis, the goal was to identify seasonal patterns of the epidemics, and predict if and when certain locations will have an epidemic on their hands. Technologies and Knowledge: NeuralNet, Python, Machine Learning, Predictive Analysis. Link for project 1: 
Project 2: Used an AWS Cloud Solutions to solve a problem envolving three different sources of data to make the ingestion, as well the storage of the data in a data lake. It also encompasses the security measures for the data lake, as well as Cloud Solutions to conduct the analysis of that dataset, be it through analytical or machine learning settings. Technolgies and Knowledge: AWS Cloud Solutions Architecture, Critical Thinking. Link for project 2: cloud_solutions/DataLake.jpg
Project 3: Used AWS Cloud solutions for the customer who had a need to run containers on AWS and to use the same orchestration device for both Cloud and on-premises. It was opted for a seamless transition to cloud-native services as demonstrated visually on the file. It was also needed to host a SQL database and to store that generated base with minimum refactoring and resilience to fallovers. Link for project 3:cloud_solutions/AWS Container With Resilience.jpg
