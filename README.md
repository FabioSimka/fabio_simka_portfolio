Project 1: I used a neural net code in a predictive analysis of the probability of a local epidemic hitting a place, according to data extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO). In this predictive analysis, the goal was to identify seasonal patterns of the epidemics, and predict if and when certain locations will have an epidemic on their hands. Technologies and Knowledge: NeuralNet, Python, Machine Learning, Predictive Analysis. 
Project 2: Used a AWS Cloud Solutions to solve a problem envolving three different sources of data to make the ingestion, as well the storage of the data in a data lake. It also encompasses the security measures for the data lake, as well as Cloud Solutions to conduct the analysis of that dataset, be it through analytical or machine learning settings. Technolgies and Knowledge: AWS Cloud Solutions Architecture, Critical Thinking.
